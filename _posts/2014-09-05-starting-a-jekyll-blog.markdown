I figure it's time to actually get serious about keeping a blog, if for no other reason than to make myself feel like I'm accomplishing something on a daily basis.  There's something about writing that makes one feel productive.  I've not quite decided if this will be dedicated mostly to coding, to the adventures and the monotony of everyday life, or both, but time will tell.

While I like the idea of jekyll over a CMS, I must admit I've hardly ever done anything with markdown or with YAML, both of which it appears I'll be getting more familiar with as I write more for this blog.
